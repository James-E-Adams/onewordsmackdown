## One word smackdown!

// Still waiting for the dns change to onewordsmackdown.xyz to flick over.

Notes:

Initially wanted to try using hooks but it didn't seem right to add event listeners
with useEffect...so I used some recompose. Heresy.

I was also super slack and did inline styles everywhere to save adding tachyons/tailwind.

If anyone has a better solution for refreshing the timer than forcing a state update,
do let me know. That was the quickest thing I came up with without typing it into google.
